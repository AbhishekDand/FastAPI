# Welcome to my FastAPI Demo for Machine Learning Applications

Welcome to our Awesome FastAPI project! This project leverages the power of FastAPI to build a high-performance, modern, and scalable web application. FastAPI is a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, and it combines the simplicity of Flask with the performance of Starlette.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/awesome-fastapi-project.git
cd awesome-fastapi-project

```


## Running the Application

``` To start the FastAPI application, run the following command:

bash
uvicorn main:app --reload ```

This will launch the application, and it will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser or HTTP client.

## API Documentation
Our Awesome FastAPI project comes with automatic API documentation powered by Swagger UI. You can access the documentation at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

This interactive documentation provides detailed information about all the available endpoints, request and response models, and even allows you to test the API directly from the web page.

## Making Predictions
If you want to make predictions using our trained ML model, use the /predict/ endpoint with the required input data. The input data should be in JSON format, following the structure of the provided columns. The ML model will then return the predictions.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have any bug fixes, enhancements, or new features to propose, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow our code of conduct and guidelines for contributing.
